Mastermind

-   randomise the ‘code’
-   ability to choose colour each for your guess
-   a button to confirm your guess
-   feedback table (correct colour & position, correct colour but not position, blank for not correct at all etc.)
-   win / lose (you run out of tries without winning)
-   reset the game

stretch ideas:

-   have cute images rather than colours for the balls
-   option to choose a theme for your game?
-   insert your name to play
    -   high score table
    -   tally of wins
-   confetti when you win?
-   code can include blank spaces?
-   ability to customise the game board:
    -   you can set the number of guess rows you get
    -   you can set the number of pins in the code
